The idea of the ScrewRap design is to make a precision 3D printer without the ridiculous price tag that comes with it. The design is also made to require minimal tools. Sofar the only tool you need is an allen key.

The overall design is based on Smartroad's Dual-Struder Fabricator, which can be found on thingiverse here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:90021. The major difference, however, is the ScrewRap uses leadscrews on all 3 axes. More details can be found on the RepRap wiki here: http://reprap.org/wiki/ScrewRap.
